_“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”_

### A childhood caught between two ages - my story

<IntroParagraph>
  In 1998, year two of Gen Z, I entered the world. This generation, mine, was
  the first to be fully immersed in the information age from birth. My childhood
  was distinctly divided by a pivotal moment in 2007, an inflection point as
  significant as the invention of the printing press. The year 2007 brought
  forth: the iPhone's debut, Facebook's universal embrace, and the cloud's first
  breath. At the tender age of 9, I stood on the threshold of a new era.
</IntroParagraph>

At 11, an iPod Touch became my gateway into the information age. Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat - these weren't just apps; they were the new language of connection, and I learned it quickly. By the time high school arrived, this language of the digital world was universal among my peers. Our rituals were synchronized: mornings commenced with Snapchat stories; nights ended in the glow of Instagram. This was the rhythm of our days.

Yet, beneath the surface, my soul was in unrest, a fact I was unaware of at the time. The unending stream of updates and the perpetual cycle of comparison, the never-ending list of videos to watch, took a hidden toll.

College years brought no change in my digital habits, but a new perspective emerged. Working with YoungLife, a middle school ministry, I saw a mirror of my own struggles that started seven years ago in these kids, but worse, a lot worse. All the “bad stuff” that used to start in high school (drinking, having sex, etc.) was now starting in sixth and seventh grade. My morning and evening rhythms of checking Instagram had evolved to an hourly or minute by minute ritual.

As adults, it’s easy to scoff at the depravity of "kids these days", but the truth is stark: the trajectory of **all** our lives has been altered since 2007, and not for the better. As Ronald Rolheiser aptly put it, we are being "distracted into spiritual oblivion.”

My own life is proof. The endless social media fueled comparison of my peers and the belief that only if I we're special among them could I be lovable, drove me to shape my life towards the "pursuit of success" - make a lot of money, have a lot of time, be loved and respected by everyone, you know… the American Dream - and to achieve it, my life moved at a frenetic pace. My mind was never at rest, always falling behind, I listened to my podcasts on 2x speed, I flushed to toilet before I was done peeing (not kidding), I ran up the stairs. Always planning the next step toward a nebulous goal of achievement and accumulation that would earn me the love and connection I so deeply desired. I lived with a murky sense that the more I did and the faster I did it would get me to those dreams. I also lived with a low grade constant gnawing that something about that sense was off. Was that really how and where I wanted to go? Was that where God was calling me? Those weren’t questions I actually asked myself, I never needed to face those questions since my iPhone was always there with a nice hit of dopamine to numb me from the gnawing that lied beneath.

It was John Mark Comer's "Ruthless Elimination of Hurry" that became a permission to pause in this fog of incessant striving. Comer's words guided me to an ancient path, one that replaces hurry for presence, noise for stillness, and striving for contentedness. It was an incredible breath of fresh air, but entirely unnatural. I could hardly sit five minutes without experiencing a tornado of throughts and impulses.

Embracing an un-hurried life meant confronting the root of noise in my life… **my iPhone.** This device, a persistent instigator of unceasing activity, needed to be tamed. I set on the journey of putting up boundaries around my phone so the dust of incessant noise could settle, undisturbed, allowing me a chance at an interior life.

To be clear, I’m not against technology as a tool. My career is writing software for big tech, I talk to the people who write “the algorithms”, and see how it works from the inside. I’m all for Alexa, FaceTime, Maps, connecting with friends, etc. Yet, the evidence is clear: our _**unrestrained**_ embrace of constant digital connection since 2007 has had profound, detrimental, effects on our well-being. In Byung-Chul Han's words,

"We are too alive to die, and too dead to live.”

_"Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will."_

If we don’t get a handle on our relationship with our phone and reclaim an un-hurried life we will never get past the gnawing low grade anxiety and enter into a deep, rich, soul satisfying interior life with God.

That's what Screen Health is here for.

**We provide two things. First, hand cultivated guided practices based on experience and second, a
searchable library of books, articles, and notes centered around digital
health.**
