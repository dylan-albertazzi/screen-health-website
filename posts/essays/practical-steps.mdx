_“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”_

### The Problem

<IntroParagraph>
  In 1998, year two of Gen Z, I entered the world. This generation, mine, was
  the first to be fully immersed in the information age from birth. My childhood
  was distinctly divided by a pivotal moment in 2007, an inflection point as
  significant as the invention of the printing press. The year 2007 brought
  forth: the iPhone's debut, Facebook's universal embrace, and the cloud's first
  breath. At the tender age of 9, I stood on the threshold of a new era.
</IntroParagraph>

At 11, an iPod Touch became my gateway into the information age. Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat - these weren't just apps; they were the new language of connection, and I learned it quickly. By the time high school arrived, this language of the digital world was universal among my peers. Our rituals were synchronized: mornings commenced with Snapchat stories; nights ended in the glow of Instagram. This was the rhythm of our days.

Yet, beneath the surface, my soul was in unrest, a fact I was unaware of at the time. The unending stream of updates and the perpetual cycle of comparison, the never-ending list of videos to watch, took a hidden toll.

College years brought no change in my digital habits, but a new perspective emerged. Working with YoungLife, a middle school ministry, I saw a mirror of my own struggles that started seven years ago in these kids, but worse, a lot worse. All the “bad stuff” that used to start in high school (drinking, having sex, etc.) was now starting in sixth and seventh grade. My morning and evening rhythms of checking Instagram had evolved to an hourly or minute by minute ritual.

As adults, it’s easy to convince ourselves that our own digital dependencies aren’t _that_ bad. But the truth is stark: the trajectory of **all** our lives has been altered since 2007, and not for the better. As Ronald Rolheiser aptly put it, we are being "distracted into spiritual oblivion.”

My own life is proof. Driven by a relentless pursuit of success - make a lot of money, have a lot of time, be loved and respected by everyone, you know… the American Dream - my life moved at a frenetic pace. My mind was never at rest, always falling behind, I listened to my podcasts on 2x speed, I flushed to toilet before I was done peeing (not kidding), I ran up the stairs. Always planning the next step toward a nebulous goal of achievement and accumulation. I lived with a murky sense that the more I did and the faster I did it would get me to those dreams. I also lived with a low grade constant gnawing that something about that sense was off. Was that really how and where I wanted to go? Was that where God was calling me? Those weren’t questions I actually asked myself, I never needed to face those questions since my iPhone was always there with a nice hit of dopamine to numb me from the gnawing that lied beneath.

It was John Mark Comer's "Ruthless Elimination of Hurry" that became a beacon of hope in this fog of incessant striving. Comer's words guided me to an ancient path, one that replaces hurry for presence, noise for stillness. Embracing an un-hurried life meant confronting the root of noise in my life… **my iPhone.** This device, a persistent instigator of unceasing activity, needed to be tamed. I set on the journey of putting up boundaries around my phone so the dust of incessant noise could settle, undisturbed, allowing me a chance at an interior life.

To be clear, I’m not against technology as a tool. My career is writing software for big tech, I talk to the people who write “the algorithms”, and see how it works from the inside. I’m all for Alexa, FaceTime, Maps, connecting with friends, etc. Yet, the evidence is clear: our unrestrained embrace of constant digital connection since 2007 has had profound, detrimental, effects on our well-being. In Byung-Chul Han's words,

<BlockquoteCitation author="Byung-Chul Han" title="The Burnout Society" url="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25490360-the-burnout-society">

"We are too alive to die, and too dead to live.”

<QuoteCard sourceTitle="Romans 12:2" >

_"Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will."_

</QuoteCard>

If we don’t get a handle on our relationship with our phone and reclaim an un-hurried life we will never get past the gnawing low grade anxiety and enter into a deep, rich, soul satisfying interior life with God.

## What the Bible says

_"Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. **3** For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. **4** When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory._

**\*5** Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. **6** Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.[b] **7** You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived. **8** But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips. **9** Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices **10** and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator."\*

_Colossians 3:2-10_

_"Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will."_

_Romans 12:2_

The Bible makes it clear that what our mind is set on is directly related to our ability to hear God, be formed like Him, and do His will. It makes a clear warning that the "patterns of this world" are the default and that they shape our minds in such a way as to keep us from hearing God and doing His will.

I find it telling that both passages emphasize renewal, not one-time resolution. The writers understood that the spiritual life wasn't a single decision in time but a practice cultivated day by day, moment by moment. Like a salmon swimming upstream, if he decides to stop swimming he'll drift right back to where he started. He needs to decide each moment to swim against the natural current which will always pull him away from his direction.

If this was a problem in ancient times, how much more true, in the age of the iPhone. We're told to "seek the kingdom first", to "set our minds of things above", to "not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our mind" but most of us have been transformed much more profoundly by our glowing screens than the spirit.

I deeply believe we need to understand what renewing our mind means practically, in the digital era, with iPhones, YouTube, messages, Slack, email, fantasy football, and the other 500 things clamoring for our attention that I'm skipping. The principals are the same as they always have been, but the tactics are different, and in this area, I believe the current is pushing more swiftly than any other in history.

### Getting Practical

In my journey so far that has meant two things, cultivating an environment that allows space to renew my mind instead of mindless consumption, and observing critically the culture we live in (how technology is addictive, the implicit lies our culture has accepted, and the motives behind the tech companies who make it).

<BlockquoteCitation author="Murray Shanahan" title="Talking About Large Language Models" url="http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03551">

Humans are members of a community of language-users inhabiting a shared world, and this primal fact makes them essentially different to large language models. We can consult the world to settle our disagreements and update our beliefs. We can, so to speak, “triangulate” on objective reality.

</BlockquoteCitation>

This leaves us with some low-hanging fruit for humanness. We can tell richly detailed stories grounded in our specific contexts and cultures: place names, sensual descriptions, local knowledge, and, well the _je ne sais quoi_ of being alive. Language models can decently mimic this style of writing but most don't without extensive prompt engineering. They stick to generics. They hedge. They leave out details. They have trouble maintaining a coherent sense of self over thousands of words.

Hipsterism and recency bias will help us here. Referencing obscure concepts, friends who are real but not famous, niche interests, and recent events all make you plausibly more human.<Footnote idName={6}>This feels eerily like a hostage holding up yesterday's newspaper to prove they are actively in danger. Perhaps a premonition.</Footnote>

### 2. Be original, critical, and sophisticated

Easier said than done, but one of the best ways to prove you're not a predictive language model is to demonstrate critical and sophisticated thinking.

Language models spit out text that sounds like a B+ college essay. Coherent, seemingly comprehensive, but never truly insightful or original (at least for now).

In a repulsively evocative metaphor, they engage in “[human centipede](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Human_Centipede_(First_Sequence)>) epistemology.”<Footnote idName={7}>I found this phrase via Twitter, but posted from a private account so I won't cite the original author.</Footnote> Language models regurgitate text from across the web, which some humans read and recycle into "original creations," which then become fodder to train other language models, and around and around we go recycling generic ideas and arguments and tropes and ways of thinking.

Hard exiting out of this cycle requires coming up with unquestionably original thoughts and theories. It means seeing and synthesising patterns across a broad range of sources: books, blogs, cultural narratives served up by media outlets, conversations, podcasts, lived experiences, and market trends. We can observe and analyse a much fuller range of inputs than bots and generative models can.

It will raise the stakes for everyone. As both consumers of content and creators of it, we'll have to foster a greater sense of critical thinking and scepticism.

This all sounds a bit rough, but there's a lot of hope in this vision. In a world of automated intelligence, our goalposts for intelligence will shift. We'll raise our quality bar for what we expect from humans. When a machine can pump out a great literature review or summary of existing work, there's no value in a person doing it.

### 3. Develop creative language quirks, dialects, memes, and jargon

The linguist [Ferdinand de Saussure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Saussure) argued there are two kinds of language:

- **La langue** is the formal concept of language. These are words we print in the dictionary, distribute via educational institutions, and reprimand one another for getting it wrong.
- **La parole** is the speech of everyday life. These are the informal, diverse, and creative speech acts we perform in conversations, social gatherings, and text to the group WhatsApp. This is where language evolves.

We have designed a system that automates a standardised way of writing. We have codified _la langue_ at a specific point in time.

What we have left to play with is _la parole_. No language model will be able to keep up with the pace of weird internet lingo and memes. I expect we'll lean into this. Using neologisms, jargon, euphemistic emoji, unusual phrases, ingroup dialects, and memes-of-the-moment will help signal your humanity.

Not unlike teenagers using language to subvert their elders, or oppressed communities developing dialects that allow them to safely communicate amongst themselves.

### 4. Consider institutional verification

This solution feels the least interesting. We're already hearing rumblings of how “verification” by centralised institutions or companies might help us distinguish between meat brains and metal brains.

The idea is something like this: you show up in person to register your online accounts or domains. You then get some kind of special badge or mark online legitimising you as a Real Human. It may or may not be on the blockchain somehow.

Google might look something like this:

<ResponsiveImage
  framed
  src="/images/posts/ai-dark-forest/human_google.jpg"
  width="1300px"
  alt="Google search results showing a 'certified human' badge on some items"
/>

The whole thing seems fraught with problems, susceptible to abuse, and ultimately impractical. Would it even be the web if everyone knew you were really a dog?

### 5. Show up in meatspace

The final edge we have over language models is that we can prove we're real humans by showing up IRL with our real human bodies. We can arrange to meet Twitter mutuals offline over coffee. We can organise meetups and events and conferences and unconferences and hangouts and pub nights.

In [Markets for Lemons and the Great Logging Off](https://www.fortressofdoors.com/ai-markets-for-lemons-and-the-great-logging-off/), Lars Doucet proposed several knock-on effects from this offline-first future. We might see increased [fetishisation](https://www.fortressofdoors.com/ai-markets-for-lemons-and-the-great-logging-off/#:~:text=a%20resurgence%20and%20even%20fetishization%20of%20explicitly%20%22offline%22%20culture%2C%20where%20the%20%22Great%20Logging%20Off%22%20becomes%20literal) of anti-screen culture, as well as [real estate](https://www.fortressofdoors.com/ai-markets-for-lemons-and-the-great-logging-off/#:~:text=Seventh%2C%20real,amenities%20are%20available) price increases in densely populated areas.

For the moment we can still check humanness over Zoom, but live video generation is getting good enough that I don't think that defence will last long.

There are, of course, many people who can't move to an offline-first life; people with physical disabilities. People who live in remote, rural places. People with limited time and caretaking responsibilities for the very young or the very old. They will have a harder time verifying their humanness online. I don't have any grand ideas to help solve this, but I hope we find better solutions than my paltry list.

As the forest grows darker, noisier, and less human, I expect to invest more time in in-person relationships and communities. And while I love meatspace, this still feels like a loss.
